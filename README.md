# Overlap
This is a derivative from my Hartree-Fock program (https://github.com/Walter-Feng/Hartree-Fock.git) that simply calculates the overlap matrix of a molecule.

It is still at an eary stage, and there might be unexpected errors. Theoretically it should be able to perform calculation on all basis sets in Basis Set Exchange (https://www.basissetexchange.org).

All comments on how to improve this program is much appreciated.
